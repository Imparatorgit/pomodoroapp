## The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into focused intervals (typically 25 minutes) separated by short breaks. The method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility.

1. Choose a task
2. Work for 25 minutes
3. Take a 5-minute break
4. After 4 pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes)
5. Repeat
