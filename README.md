## The Pomodoro Technique

Let me tell you about the Pomodoro Technique - it's this amazing time management method that Francesco Cirillo came up with back in the late 1980s. The idea is super simple but incredibly effective: work in focused chunks (usually 25 minutes) with short breaks in between. It's based on the idea that your brain works better with regular breaks.

Here's how it works:

1. Pick something you need to work on
2. Focus on it for 25 minutes
3. Take a quick 5-minute break
4. After 4 pomodoros, treat yourself to a longer break (15-30 minutes)
5. Rinse and repeat!
